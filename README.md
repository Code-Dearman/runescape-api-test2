# RuneTask

RuneTask is a simple, users-friendly to-do list web app built with Django. Users can create, manage and track their goals with the option to link their current runescape character details in order to keep track of their goals. This project was created as part of my Code Institute 16 week bootcamp course. The aim is to use the Django framework to create a full-stack project which is hosted on Heroku. There must be a custom database table and the app must provide some CRUD functionality.

## How to use the app

Using the app is simple! Unregistered users can stay on the homepage to view tasks which registered users have made public. However, to start working with the app you must register. 

Click the 'Sign Up' link in the navigation bar to create and account. Once this step is complete you can start making lists. Navigate to the 'Profile' link and press the 'New Task' button. Here you can specify what skill you are planning to train, outline what steps you must take (using the rich text editor) and choose whether to make the list public or keep it private.

For even greater functionality you can use the 'link character' button feature to safely use runescape's own Oldschool Hiscrores API to retrieve details about your character. Doing this allows your profile to display your current stats which you can incorporate into the task list. 

If you feel like customising you profile feel free to choose from a range of provided profile images.

When you've completed your task you can edit the task list and mark it as complete. Feel free to upload a screenshot of your success!

## UX - User Experience

_Description of how I decided on the colour palettes and why I made certain choices. Discuss the accessibility and responsiveness of the app._

## Project Planning

### Agile

This project was created using the agile methodology, particularly in relation to creating granular user stories which streamlines the development process. All of these user stories were gathered into a project kanban board on GitHub where I could pull stories from the backlog to the in progress column. Once I had completed the tasks they were moved into the completed column.

### User Stories

_All user stories marked with could should might and wont_

### MoSCoW

All of the user stories I created were sorted using the MoSCoW (Must have, Should Have, Could Have and Wont Have) prioritisation system. This system allowed me to organise my userstories, making sure that all the must haves formed my minimum viable product. Once those were completed I could advance towards including my Should and Could have user stories which would provide extra features for the user and lead to a more finished product. My wont have stories outlines features which were not in the scope of this development cycle but helped me to keep a focus on where the project is leading.

## Automated Testing

Automated tests for the Django features were written using the inbuilt test capablities of Django. These allowed me to conduct the tests withing the development environment while keeping my deployed database safe.
