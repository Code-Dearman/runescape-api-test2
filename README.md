# Code Institute Capstone Project: RuneTask

This is a simple, users-friendly to-do list web app built with Django. Users can create, manage and track their goals with the option to link their current runescape character details in order to keep track of their goals.

## How to use the app

Using the app is simple! Unregistered users can stay on the homepage to view tasks which registered users have made public. However, to start working with the app you must register. 

Click the 'Sign Up' link in the navigation bar to create and account. Once this step is complete you can start making lists. Navigate to the 'Profile' link and press the 'New Task' button. Here you can specify what skill you are planning to train, outline what steps you must take (using the rich text editor) and choose whether to make the list public or keep it private.

For even greater functionality you can use the 'link character' button feature to safely use runescape's own Oldschool Hiscrores API to retrieve details about your character. Doing this allows your profile to display your current stats which you can incorporate into the task list. 

If you feel like customising you profile feel free to choose from a range of provided profile images.

When you've completed your task you can edit the task list and mark it as complete. Feel free to upload a screenshot of your success!
